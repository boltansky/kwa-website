The quantum-field laser laboratory is led by Prof. Kyungwon An. Its research interest covers the cavity-QED microlaser, single-atom single-photon quantum interface and quantum chaos in microcavities. For detailed information on our research, please see [Research] section. Prof. An, as a PI, have successfully completed the WCU (world class university) project (type 2) collaborating with Profs. Hyunseok Jung and Yong-il Shin in fundamental studies with Bose-Einstein condensates and their applications.

It is after the mid 20th century that the human race began to control the light absorption and emission as they intend. By understanding the light-matter interaction, the phenomenon that light changes the state of matter and the matter changes that of light in turn, various technical applications have been made. Through extensive researches till now, two fundamental principles have been identified that can enhance the light-matter interaction. The first is the Purcell effect and the second is the Petermann effect. The Purcell effect is based on the enhancement in vacuum electromagnetic fields and it is well explained by the cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), which is the field where S. Haroche was awarded a Nobel Prize in physics in 2012. The less-known Petermann effect is referred to the phenomenon that the light-matter coupling is increased due to the bi-orthogonality of resonant modes in a non-Hermitian system. It has been often studied in the context of excess spontaneous emission noise in unstable resonators.
<br><br>
Our laboratory performs various researches to investigate the light-matter interaction at the most fundamental level based on these two principles. We study quantum optics and quantum information by using atom-cavity systems, single-atom trapping and optical lattices. In asymmetric microcavities, we investigate quantum chaos in the context of inter-mode interactions, dynamical tunneling and the interaction between a gain medium and bi-orthogonal cavity modes. Through these studies, we aim to discover new phenomena and apply them to ultrahigh-efficient quantum light sources and quantum information processing.
