        <div>We study the quantum Goos-Haenchen (GH) effect in two quantum systems, a normal/superconductor (NS) interface and a curved step potential, by investigating the time evolution of a wave packet. In the case of NS interface, we find that the GH effect is amplified by the ratio of Fermi energy to the pair gap. Interestingly, the effect appears only as a time delay without any lateral shift. This makes the NS interface ‘sticky’. For the curved step potential, we show that the GH shift along the step boundary can be explained by the energy-dependent phase loss upon reflection, which is defined by modifying the one-dimensional (1D) effective potential derived from the two-dimensional circular system. We also demonstrate that the tunneling transmission of the wave packet is characterized by a free-space image distant from the boundary. The tunneling transmission exhibits a rather wide angle divergence and the direction of maximum tunneling is slightly rotated from the tangent at the incident point, which is consistent with the time delay of the tunneling wave packet computed in the 1D modified effective potential.

        <div>Obituary</div>
        <div>Prof. Soo-Young Lee, 47, passed away because of cerebral hemorrhage on July 1, 2014, about one month after this seminar. We all were deeply struck by his sudden death. Dr. Soo-Young Lee had made numerous contributions to quantum chaos in deformed microcavities. He was an avid soccer player. He enjoyed much to interact with students and to help them to solve problems for themselves. We all cherish the happy times that we had with him.
